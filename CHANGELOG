Added nested group support
--------------------------

**This feature is in-development**

 * The internal groups app was externalized as django-groups.
 
 * Group base model was given two new fields: content_type and object_id for
   nesting groups (these field names are subject to change).
 
 * group_slug has been replaced with group-level specific naming. For example
   in the previous groups support group apps would hook up a content object
   apps such as::
   
       bridge = ContentBridge(Project, "projects")
       ...
       urlpatterns += bridge.include_urls('topics.urls', r'^project/(?P<group_slug>[-\w]+)/topics/')
   
   We can no longer rely on group_slug as shown above since content object
   apps can now be group apps. The new and correct way is to use the lower
   case form of the model name::
   
       bridge = ContentBridge(Project)
       ...
       urlpatterns += bridge.include_urls("topics.urls", r"^project/(?P<project_slug>[-\w]+)/topics/")
   
   Notice the second argument to ContentBridge is no longer needed. It now
   uses the app_label for the model by default.
 
 * The new signature of ContentBridge.get_group has changed from::
   
       bridge.get_group(group_slug)
   
   to::
   
        bridge.get_group(**kwargs)
   
   where kwargs comes from the new required view signature::
   
       def project_detail(request, pk, **kwargs):
           ...
   
   The reason for this change is because the data you get from the URL has
   slightly changed as well.
 
 * TODO


Added a new starter project for serving up static media and templates
---------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Allows HTML mockups to have a ready Pinax layout and take advantage of the 
   Django templating language.
